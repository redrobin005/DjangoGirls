    # the URL resolver will ignore the domain name (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and match with whatver follows
    # in this case since we will match with an empty string 
    # since http://127.0.0.1:8000/ is our home page URL this will match  
    # and everything that comes in with this address will be routed to blog.urls for furhter instruction
